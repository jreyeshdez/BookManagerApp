BookManagerApp
==============

Development of a personal music manager application using Struts 2, 
Hibernate and MySQL database. The web application can be used to add 
your book collection to the database. There will be a form to add 
the record and underneath you will show all the book collections. 
From each row the record can be deleted by clicking ‘Delete’ link. I 
have chosen Struts2 as this is one of the flexible J2EE framework. 
The database is MySQL and we have used Hibernate as ORM tool.
